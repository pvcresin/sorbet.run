## Complaints about stubborn codebases

- _Our code isn't modular enough!_

::: incremental

- _This dependency is 10 years out of date!_

- _We need to change how we talk to the database!_

- ...

:::

. . .

### ‚Üí We can refactor to a happy state!

## Best to centralize the refactor ‚òÄÔ∏è

Have **one team** drive the refactor:

* **concentrates expertise**\
  most problems will be repeat problems

- **incentivizes automation**\
  fewer man-hours overall

- **avoids idle time**\
  no need to wait for each team to plan and prioritize

## Centralized migration needs two things:

<!-- TODO(jez) Better diagrams -->

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
**Leverage** over the codebase

::: {.column width="55%"}
Way to **ratchet** incremental progress

## Thesis

\

to successfully &nbsp; **refactor large, stubborn codebases**

you need to &nbsp; **have a point of leverage** &nbsp; and &nbsp; **pick good ratchets**

<!-- TODO(jez) Should you expand on these here? -->




\

\

## Agenda üéØ

\

- **Improving developer satisfaction with Sorbet**

- Making a Ruby monolith more modular

## Brief history of Sorbet üë®‚Äçüè´

- Began fall 2017
- Stripe: **\~800** employees (200 -- 400 engineers)
- Initial project: 3 engineers, full time

Timeline

- **9 months** to build Sorbet...\
  ... but has served as the foundation for hundreds of
  codemods
- **3 months** to get to 75% adoption...\
  ...contained to just three engineers

## Ratcheting in Sorbet...

**`# typed:`** comment at the top of each file

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="30%"}
`# typed:` **`false`**\
`# typed:` **`true`**\
`# typed:` **`strict`**
:::
:::{.column width="70%"}
‚Üí just syntax and constants\
‚Üí inference in methods\
‚Üí every method needs a signature
:::
::::

... is **local**, **incremental**, and **actionable**

::: notes

Getting started just means flipping a single comment in the
file you're already working in.

Only get type errors once you start adding annotations.

Once you add **`# typed: true`**, your reviewer is going to
be really suspicious of downgrading to **`# typed: false`**
vs just using **`T.unsafe`** to regress one call
site---discourages backsliding

:::

## üí° **local**, **incremental**, and **actionable**

Alternatives to `# typed:` comment:

- by folder or by team ‚Üí too broad\
  (not local enough, not incremental enough)

- by method or by percent within a file ‚Üí too granular\
  (noisy, hard to action)

## Thesis

Developer satisfaction improved because we:

::::{.columns style="gap: min(4vw, 0.5em);"}
:::{.column style="width:6%; text-align:right;"}
\
by\
and
:::
:::{.column width="94%"}
**refactored a large, stubborn codebase**\
**having a point of leverage** (Sorbet)\
**picking good ratchets** (`# typed:`)
